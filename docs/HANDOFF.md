## 2026-05-14T14:14Z — Stage 8 Hermes design (D-88 done, D-86 mid-resolution)

### Goal
Resolve all five Stage 8 Hermes design questions (D-86–D-90) so Stage 8 coding can begin.

### Active task
D-86 sub-question: defaults for `whiz hermes profile create`, framed via existing-Hermes-user migration shapes (Parallel / Migrate / Clean cell). Lean: Option C (Whizzard-native verb, not auto-create and not Hermes-CLI-direct) with `--clone-from default` as the default flag plus `--clone-from <other>` and `--no-clone` escape valves; clone must explicitly omit `auth.json` to preserve D-80. Bryan was about to answer "is Parallel common in the wild, or will most users go straight to Migrate?" — that determines how much weight to give host/cell drift in the docs.

### Tried & rejected
- **D-86 Option A** (auto-create profile on first launch): silent state mutation; typo failure mode (`whiz hermes whizard-cell` mistyped spawns a bogus profile and starts running).
- **D-86 Option B** (require user to run `hermes profile create` themselves): violates "Whiz easier than yolo"; couples Whizzard tightly to Hermes CLI shape across versions.
- **D-88 silent fallback** to interactive mode when no platforms configured: misconfigured profile should fail loudly, not silently land user in wrong mode.
- **Mount user's default Hermes profile directly**: tension with D-80 — `auth.json` lives inside the profile dir and would enter the cell.

### Resume protocol
1. Get Bryan's Parallel-vs-Migrate read.
2. Capture D-86 as resolved in `DECISIONS.md` §10 with the `whiz hermes profile create` verb plus `--clone-from`/`--no-clone` flags; note the `auth.json` omission requirement.
3. Update the open-questions tracker; commit + ff-merge.
4. Ask which of D-87 / D-89 / D-90 to take next.
5. `docs/session_handoff.md` is stale (pre-D-150/D-151 rename); read `docs/HANDOFF.md` instead. `docs/skill-drafts/` holds uncommitted spec drafts Bryan is iterating on — don't move or commit without checking.

Don't push to close D-86 prematurely — the sub-question is real and Bryan steered toward it deliberately.
